    "In this notebook you will explore FDEM data, evaluating the spatial variations and how the collected datasets relate to different soil volumes. By combining collected datasets in a GIS, you can explore how the observed variations relate to known soil information. In a last step, you will be able to evaluate the collected data in a more quantitative way by performing an inversion.\n",

Running that cell and **_code cell 0.1_**  installs the required packages in Google Colaboratory, and subsequently import all required packages into the workspace.\n",

You can change it to any of the data column names of the FDEM survey dataset, shown in *Table 1*. The second variable to set is the grid cell size (`cell_size` variable), which specifies the resolution of the final grid in meters. You can export the interpolated dataset as a GeoTIF using the `export_grid` function for use in a GIS program, by setting te `export` variable to `True`.

    "# 3. FDEM data inversion\n",
    "\n",
    "Until now, you have worked with raw FDEM data. The QP output of the instrument is given as LIN ECa data, apparent EC data that consider a simple, linear relationship between the subsurface EC, and the QP instrument output. Hereby, the EC of all materials influencing the measurement is considered to be uniform, hence the 'apparent' nature of the data.\n",
    "  \n",
    "To evaluate the 'true' conductivity of the subsurface, we have to perform an inversion. In the following code cells, you can perform an inversion on the available FDEM datasets. More specifically, you can invert the ECa data layers collected during the survey, to model the subsurface conductivity. Through this process, you can create vertical sections (across the provided reference transect), and depth slices for specific depth ranges\n",
    "  \n",
    "To perform the inversion, we use the open-source EM modelling package [EMagPy](https://pypi.org/project/emagpy/), developed by [McLachlan et al. 2021](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0098300420305513). The sources code for this package is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/hkexgroup/emagpy/tree/master/src/emagpy).\n",
    "  \n",
    "All inversion procedures are driven by a forward model. As discussed, the forward model allows predicting the response obtained with a specific geophysical instrument used in a specific configuration, given an assumed subsurface model, described by a set of parameters. The underlying model builds on the sensitivities plotted in code block 1.2, only it integrates the cumulative sensitivity (CS) functions that describe how much of the total QP response (or, the ECa) of the instrument can be attributed to EC variations at different depths.\n",
    "  \n",
    "These CS functions assume that the sensitivity of the instrument depends only on the depth and the used coil configuration, and is independent of the subsurface EC and the instrument's operating frequency. More comprehensive models can be deployed as well in EMagPy, but these are beyond the scope of this exercise.\n",
    "\n",
    "In **_code cell 3.0_**, you will perform an example inversion along the reference transect. The EMagPy program reads from .csv-files, so the dataset path is the URL that is specified at the beginning of this notebook (stored in the `FDEM_transect` variable). \n",
    "You will implement the inversion in a very basic way. The initial parameter you will set is:\n",
    "- depths0: initial depths in meters of the bottom of each layer to be modelled. The bottom layer boundary is set to infinity (Numpy array with n depths).\n",
    "\n",
    "By loading the .csv files, EMagPy automatically recognises the data columns and coil configurations, and makes use of all ECa datasets to perform the inversion.\n",
    "\n",
    "All parameters of the inversion have been preset like this:\n",
    "> `transect.invert(forwardModel='CS', alpha=0.13, njobs=-1)` \n",

    "This includes the forward model to use (the cumulative sensitivity), and an alpha parameter that smooths the inversion.\n",

    "(<i>You can evaluate the use of different forward models by changing the > `forwardModel` argument in the function to 'FSlin' (which implements the full solution of Maxwell's equations, with LIN approximation) or with 'FSeq' (which implements the full solution of Maxwell's equations, without the approximation). These models are more robust, but come at a higher computational cost. A practical comparison of these procedures can be found [here](https://hkex.gitlab.io/emagpy/gallery/nb_paper-cs-vs-fs.html)<i>)"
